Welcome! This page contains puzzles I've worked on, whether it be alone or with others. Puzzles where I've worked with others are marked to be collaborative; these range from receiving or providing some construction help, to full-fledged collaboration and anything in between. Puzzles that don't have links are part of hunts that have not taken place yet.
