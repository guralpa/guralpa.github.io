Welcome! This page contains puzzles I've worked on, whether it be alone or with others. Puzzles where I've worked with others are marked to be collaborative; this is a wide spectrum, and includes puzzles where I joined the drafting process after testsolving it, or puzzles where a testsolver joined me in bringing the puzzle to a better state. I've linked puzzles where possible, modulo broken / unpublished sites.

If you believe there is a puzzle here that should not be listed or linked, please reach out to me so I can correct it.
