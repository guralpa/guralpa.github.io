Aren is an undergraduate at Brown University studying Mathematics and Computer Science. He is broadly interested in algebra, formal theorem provers, and homotopy type theory. He is currently participating in the [Mathematics Summer DRP](https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/drp-brown-math/apply) here at Brown, on Computational Algebraic Geometry [Cox, Little, O'Shea], and is working on a math formalization project under the guidance of [Robert Lewis](robertylewis.com). He is a proud alum of the [Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics](https://hcssim.org/) program. Go Yellow Pigs!

Outside of academics, he likes to solve puzzles, play video and board games, and drink boba tea. His creative work can best be described as experiments in storytelling; he has told stories through puzzle design, poetry, (short) playwriting, cyoa game design, and others. He delights in climbing high places, like those found at Rock Spot Providence, where he boulders in the v3-4 range.
