Aren is a second-year undergraduate at Brown University studying Mathematics. He is interested in all fields of mathematics, and finds their intersections fascinating, though algebraic geometry is a favorite at the moment. He is currently studying in Budapest as part of [Budapest Semesters in Mathematics](https://budapestsemesters.com). Aren is a proud alum of [HCSSiM](https://hcssim.org/). Go Yellow Pigs!

Outside of academics, he likes to solve puzzles, play video and board games, and read, which he's always happy to receive suggestions for. His creative pursuits often center on puzzle design, with a focus on story, but he has also written pieces of various other non-traditional forms. 

He delights in climbing high places, like those found at Rock Spot Providence, where he boulders in the v4-5 range.
