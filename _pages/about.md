Hi! I'm Aren, a third-year undergraduate at Brown University studying mathematics. I'm interested in algebra and geometry, and I'm currently working on a research project advised by [Eric Larson](https://www.math.brown.edu/elarso19/). I'm a proud dual-alum of [Budapest Semesters in Mathematics](https://budapestsemesters.com) and [HCSSiM](https://hcssim.org/).

Outside of classes, I enjoy reading and writing -- this includes poetry, prose, and puzzles. My go-to solution when I am stuck on a problem is to take a walk to Prospect terrace and look out over the city. At the moment, I'm reading (listening to) Monster: Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson, and postsolving the Teammate 2025 puzzlehunt.

I keep an [anonymous feedback form](https://forms.gle/3JMuCTAURa3C8fgh9), inspired by Cate Hall. I am grateful for any feedback you choose to share with me.
