Aren is an undergraduate at Brown University studying Mathematics and Computer Science. He is broadly interested in algebra, formal theorem provers, and homotopy type theory. He is currently working on a math formalization project under the guidance of [Robert Lewis](https://robertylewis.com/), and thinking about what courses to take next semester. Aren is a proud alum of [HCSSiM](https://hcssim.org/). Go Yellow Pigs!

Outside of academics, he likes to solve puzzles, play video and board games, and drink boba tea. In his creative work, he experiments with storytelling; he has told stories through puzzle design, poetry, short playwriting, CYOA game design, and others. He delights in climbing high places, like those found at Rock Spot Providence, where he boulders in the v3-4 range.
