feelings
- exciting
- daunting
- uncertain

thoughts
- unsure of how to even start
- what will my first line say about me?
- what does my approach to blogging say about me?
- what *is* my approach to blogging?
- revised: *what is my blogging philosophy?*
- the obvious answer seems to be: my blog should benefit my readers in some way (after all, they're putting in the time to read it)
- caveat: i also want to be able to just write my thoughts down
- solution: signpost what posts exist to be beneficial and what posts exist for my sake. you might still get something out of these, but they will fundamentally be about *me and my thoughts*. hence, I'll be calling them *thoughts*
- the posts that i will write to benefit you will be categorized *beneficial*. these will be defined as those posts which i intend to be beneficial from the get-go
- in the middle, we'll have posts that bring the two together: non-technical, yet me still talking about my work, creative or technical. these will be called *for us*. this blog is as much a place for us to meet as for me to shout my thoughts into the void
- i can make use of tags/categories to separate these out, once i figure out how they work.

general tags i feel i will make posts including:
- math
- code
- life
- creative (split further if needed)

these will probably change over now! but we need to start somewhere. 
i'll type this up nicely at some point, but this should do the job for now.
